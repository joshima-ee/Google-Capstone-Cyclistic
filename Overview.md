# How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Introduction
  For the Google Data Analytics Capstone, I decided to complete the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study. I used Google’s data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act) as a guideline for this case study. In this scenario, I was a junior data analyst in the Cyclistic marketing analytics team being managed by the director of marketing, Lily Moreno. Cyclistic is a company which launched a bike-share program last 2016 that has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Bikes can be unlocked and returned to any station within the network at any time.
  
  The company’s general marketing objectives were to increase brand awareness and gain customers from a broad consumer segment.One strategy was their flexible pricing plan: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes were referred to as casual riders while customers who purchased annual memberships were Cyclistic members. 

  Cyclistic’s finance analysts concluded that annual members were much more profitable than casual riders. With this information, Lily Moreno believed that maximizing annual memberships would lead to the company’s success and thus planned to design a marketing strategy that would make casual riders avail annual memberships. The director believed that casual riders have a high chance to avail annual membership as they were already aware about and chose the company’s services for their mobility needs. 

  In order to devise an effective marketing program, the following questions must be investigated by the marketing analytics team:
* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

  Lily Moreno assigned the question “How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?” to me. This question was the focus of the entire case study.

## Business Task
  Identify differentiating factors of annual members and casual riders based on the latest 12 months of historical trip data and create an effective business plan to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Key Stakeholders
* Cyclistic Executive Team
  * Notoriously detail-oriented executive team who will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
* Lily Moreno
  * The director of marketing of the company and direct supervisor.
  * Responsible for the development of marketing campaigns and initiatives of the bike-share program which may include email, social media, and other channels. 
  * Aims to devise a marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members 

## Data Source
  For the purpose of this case study, the public dataset of Divvy by Motivate International Inc will be used as Cyclistic’s historical trip data. The study used the latest available 12 months worth of data from the cloud through AWS. For data-privacy, no identifiable information of the rider is provided such as credit card information and home address.

## Data Cleaning
  This case study used the dataset for the year of 2022 as it was the available dataset at the time of download. The dataset initially came as monthly CSV files that contain 5,667,717 rows when combined with 13 columns each.
